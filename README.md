Tool to manage User




is a  tool that allows you to query your LDAP directory without going through the classic dsa interface,
in order to optimize the work of technicians and avoid any mishandling (accidental deletion or modification of an account,
group, post, account of service ...).
It runs on any workstation equipped with the RSAT tool, installation or activation of the dsa user interface is not necessary.
